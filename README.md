Spam checker

This project was created to assist in detecting spam emails. It accomplished this by collecting percentages of which words are more frequent in spam emails. Once these percentages have been taken the program then can read through emails and determine if a message is spam or not by the frequency of spam words occurring and their percentage values. Once completed the program formats these into an organized table as seen below. We updated the visual aspect of the table to give it a less bleak appearance. This program operates by running it, and then  inputting the directory of emails that you want to filter through. 


How to successfully run the project:

1. After Cloning the project on your machine, use Intellij to run the project

2. When you run it, you’ll be prompted to choose a directory, you need to locate the Assignment1_data/data/Train directory and choose it. This will initialize the training phase of the project.

3. When the training phase is complete, you’ll be prompted to choose another directory. This time you need to choose the Test directory under Assignment1_data/data. This will initialize the testing phase and output the results in a UI.
